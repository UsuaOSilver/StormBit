## Overview 

StormBit aims to democratize access to credit, especially targeting the 99% who are traditionally underserved by conventional financial institutions. It offers various agreement types, enabling lenders and borrowers to interact transparently and efficiently in a decentralized environment.


## Architecture 

### Actors 

- **Lender**: Individual willing to contribute to a shared pool and participate in voting to approve or deny loans. Lenders have full control over their pool's - functionalities.
- **Borrower**: Individual seeking or currently managing a loan within a pool. Borrowers can oversee all aspects of their loans, including repayments.
- **User**: Accounts with the ability to view data on the app but limited interaction capabilities with most pools.
- **Pool Manager**: User with the authority to vote on loan approvals within their designated pool.

### Governance & Loans Allocation 

Loan allocation is governed by a voting process, with each loan request presented as a proposal. The StormBitLending contract, inheriting necessary governance functionalities from OpenZeppelin, oversees this process. Key on-chain transactions include:

- **Proposal Creation**: Initiated when a borrower requests a loan, either by depositing collateral (NFT or ERC-20 tokens) or opting for a collateral-free agreement (Simple Agreement).
- **Casting Vote**: Exclusive to stakers, allowing them to vote on loan allocations. 
- **Voting Cool Down Period**: Introduces a delay before considering a voter's input as valid, preventing potential voting power manipulation.


### Agreements on StormBit

StormBit offers three types of loan agreements:

- **Simple Agreement** : Focuses on trust and the borrower's reputation, allowing undercollateralized loans. It is streamlined for flexibility and simplicity, emphasizing financial terms over asset involvement.


- **ERC721 Agreement** : Uses NFTs as collateral, ensuring loan security. This agreement includes mechanisms for collateral management and secure NFT custody, allowing borrowers to reclaim their NFT upon fulfilling loan terms.


- **ERC-20 Agreement** : Requires collateral equal to or greater than the loan amount for security. It captures essential loan initiation details and manages collateral throughout the loan lifecycle.


#### Security and Trust
All agreements undergo rigorous security audits, including fuzzing tests, to ensure the highest security standards. Additional checks, such as a voting power cooldown variable, are implemented to safeguard against malicious activities.


## How it works 

#### Flow 

StormBit facilitates credit access by offering diverse agreement types. Any user can request a loan and receive equitable treatment from the pool's owners, bridging the gap between DeFi and traditional finance.

#### Credit Score Oracle

## Technologies and Innovations

Deployed on the [XDC network](https://xdc.org/), StormBit leverages state-of-the-art technologies to enhance scalability and inclusivity:


#### **ZEEBU**: 


- **Integration of ZBU token for governance** : 
  ZEEBU token plays a key role in the architecture of Stormbit as it is the included in the lending process. ZEEBU tokens are distributed to borrowers from the pool where lenders have deposited. Here is a diagram showing how it works with ZBU token.
